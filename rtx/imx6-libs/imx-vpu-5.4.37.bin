NXP SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT

This is a legal agreement between you, as an authorized representative of your
employer, or if you have no employer, as an individual (together "you"), and
NXP B.V. ("NXP").  It concerns your rights to use the software identified in
the Software Content Register and provided to you in binary or source code form
and any accompanying written materials (the "Licensed Software"). The Licensed
Software may include any updates or error corrections or documentation relating
to the Licensed Software provided to you by NXP under this License. In
consideration for NXP allowing you to access the Licensed Software, you are
agreeing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. If you do not agree to all
of the terms of this Agreement, do not download or install the Licensed
Software. If you change your mind later, stop using the Licensed Software and
delete all copies of the Licensed Software in your possession or control. Any
copies of the Licensed Software that you have already distributed, where
permitted, and do not destroy will continue to be governed by this Agreement.
Your prior use will also continue to be governed by this Agreement.

1.1.                  For NXP, the term "Affiliate" means (i) any Person
Controlled by NXP Semiconductors N.V. or (ii) any Person Controlled by any
transferee of all or substantially all of the assets of NXP Semiconductors
N.V., where "Controlled" means the direct or indirect beneficial ownership of
more than fifty percent (50%) of the voting stock, or decision-making authority
in the event that there is no voting stock, in another entity; provided, any
such Person described in clause (i) or (ii) shall be deemed to be an
"Affiliate" only for so long as such Person is Controlled by NXP Semiconductors
N.V. or such transferee. For the purposes of this definition, "Person" is
defined to mean "an individual, corporation, partnership, limited liability
company, association, unincorporated association, trust or other entity or
organization, including a government or political subdivision or an agency or
instrumentality thereof."

1.2.                  "Essential Patent" means a patent to the limited extent
that infringement of such patent cannot be avoided in remaining compliant with
the technology standards implicated by the usage of any of the Licensed
Software, including optional implementation of the standards, on technical but
not commercial grounds, taking into account normal technical practice and the
state of the art generally available at the time of standardization.

1.3.                  "Intellectual Property Rights" means any and all rights
under statute, common law or equity in and under copyrights, trade secrets, and
patents (including utility models), and analogous rights throughout the world,
including any applications for and the right to apply for, any of the foregoing.

1.4.                  "Software Content Register" means the documentation
accompanying the Licensed Software which identifies the contents of the
Licensed Software, including but not limited to identification of any Third
Party Software.

1.5.                  "Third Party Software" means, any software included in

world-wide, personal, non-transferable, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable,
license, under NXP's Intellectual Property Rights:

(a)     to use and reproduce the Licensed Software only as part of, or
integrated within, Authorized Systems and not on a standalone basis;
(b)     to directly or indirectly manufacture, demonstrate, copy, distribute,
market and sell the Licensed Software in object code (machine readable) only as
part of, or embedded within, Authorized Systems in object code form and not on
a standalone basis.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, those files marked as .h
files ("Header files") may be distributed in source or object code form, but
only as part of, or embedded within Authorized Systems.
(c)     to copy, use and distribute as needed, solely in connection with an
Authorized System, proprietary NXP information associated with the Licensed

stringent than those contained in this Agreement.  You will remain liable for
your subcontractors' adherence to the terms of this Agreement and for any and
all acts and omissions of such subcontractors with respect to this Agreement
and the Licensed Software.

from selling or otherwise distributing the Licensed Software, or any portion
thereof, except as expressly permitted herein.  This Agreement does not grant
to you any implied rights under any NXP or third party intellectual property.

3.3.                  You may not translate, reverse engineer, decompile, or

specifically prohibits such restriction.  You must prohibit your sublicensees
from translating, reverse engineering, decompiling, or disassembling the
Licensed Software except to the extent applicable law specifically prohibits
such restriction.

purpose any suggestion, comment or other feedback related to the Licensed
Software (including, but not limited to, error corrections and bug fixes).

3.7.                  You will not take or fail to take any action that could
subject the Licensed Software to an Excluded License. An Excluded License means

however, you must advise NXP of any results obtained including any problems or
suggested improvements thereof.  NXP retains the right to use such results and
related information in any manner it deems appropriate.

4.                 OPEN SOURCE.         Open source software included in the
Licensed Software is not licensed under the terms of this Agreement, but is
instead licensed under the terms of the applicable open source license(s), such
as the BSD License, Apache License or the GNU Lesser General Public License.

will vest in you. Your modifications to the Licensed Software, and all
intellectual property rights associated with, and title thereto, will be the
property of NXP.  Upon request, you must provide NXP the source code of any
derivative of the Licensed Software.  You agree to assign all, and hereby do
assign all rights, title, and interest to any such modifications to the

requested by NXP to establish, preserve or enforce such right.  Further, you
agree to waive all moral rights relating to your modifications to the Licensed
Software, including, without limitation, all rights of identification of
authorship and all rights of approval, restriction, or limitation on use or
subsequent modification.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, you will have the
license rights granted in Section 2 hereto to any such modifications made by
you or your licensees.

15.1.               In some cases, NXP may promote certain Licensed Software
for use in safety-related applications. NXP's goal is to educate licensees so
that they can design their own end-product solutions to meet applicable
functional safety standards and requirements.  You make the ultimate design
decisions regarding your products and are solely responsible for compliance
with all legal, regulatory, safety, and security related requirements
concerning your products, regardless of any information or support that may be
provided by NXP.  Accordingly, you will indemnify and hold NXP harmless from
any claims, liabilities, damages and associated costs and expenses (including
attorneys' fees) that NXP may incur related to your incorporation of any
product in a safety-critical application or system.

15.2.               Only Licensed Software that NXP has specifically designated
as "Automotive Qualified" is intended for use in automotive, military, or
aerospace applications or environments.  If you use Licensed Software that has
not been designated as "Automotive Qualified" in an automotive, military, or
aerospace application or environment, you do so at your own risk.

15.3.               Licensed Software is not intended or authorized for any use
in anti-personnel landmines.

16.              CHOICE OF LAW; VENUE.  This Agreement will be governed by,
construed, and enforced in accordance with the laws of The Netherlands, without
regard to conflicts of laws principles, will apply to all matters relating to
this Agreement or the Licensed Software, and you agree that any litigation will
be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Amsterdam, The
Netherlands.  The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
Sale of Goods will not apply to this document.

17.              CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.  Subject to the license grants and
restrictions contained herein, you must treat the Licensed Software as
confidential information and you agree to retain the Licensed Software in
confidence perpetually, with respect to Licensed Software in source code form
(human readable), or for a period of five (5) years from the date of
termination of this Agreement, with respect to all other parts of the Licensed
Software.  During this period, you may not disclose any part of the Licensed
Software to anyone other than employees, or sub-contractors in accordance with
Section 2.4 who have a need to know of the Licensed Software and who have
executed written agreements obligating them to protect such Licensed Software
to at least the same degree of care as in this Agreement.  You agree to use the
same degree of care, but no less than a reasonable degree of care, with the
Licensed Software as you do with your own confidential information. You may
disclose Licensed Software to the extent required by a court or under operation
of law or order provided that you notify NXP of such requirement prior to
disclosure, which you only disclose information required, and that you allow
NXP the opportunity to object to such court or other legal body requiring such
disclosure.

18.              TRADEMARKS.  You are not authorized to use any NXP trademarks,
brand names, or logos.

19.              ENTIRE AGREEMENT.  This Agreement constitutes the entire
agreement between you and NXP regarding the subject matter of this Agreement,
and supersedes all prior communications, negotiations, understandings,
agreements or representations, either written or oral, if any.  This Agreement
may only be amended in written form, signed by you and NXP.

20.              SEVERABILITY.  If any provision of this Agreement is held for
any reason to be invalid or unenforceable, then the remaining provisions of
this Agreement will be unimpaired and, unless a modification or replacement of
the invalid or unenforceable provision is further held to deprive you or NXP of
a material benefit, in which case the Agreement will immediately terminate, the
invalid or unenforceable provision will be replaced with a provision that is
valid and enforceable and that comes closest to the intention underlying the
invalid or unenforceable provision.

21.              NO WAIVER.  The waiver by NXP of any breach of any provision
of this Agreement will not operate or be construed as a waiver of any other or
a subsequent breach of the same or a different provision.

22.              AUDIT.  You will keep full, clear and accurate records with
respect to your compliance with the limited license rights granted under this
Agreement for three years following expiration or termination of this
Agreement. NXP will have the right, either itself or through an independent
certified public accountant to examine and audit, at NXP's expense, not more
than once a year, and during normal business hours, all such records that may
bear upon your compliance with the limited license rights granted above. You
must make prompt adjustment to compensate for any errors and/or omissions
disclosed by such examination or audit.

23.              NOTICES.             All notices and communications under this
Agreement will be made in writing, and will be effective when received at the
following addresses:

contractors.  Nothing in this Agreement will be construed to create any
partnership, joint venture, or similar relationship.  Neither party is
authorized to bind the other to any obligations with third parties.

25.              SUCCESSION AND ASSIGNMENT.   This Agreement will be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their permitted successors and
assigns.  You may not assign this Agreement, or any part of this Agreement,
without the prior written approval of NXP, which approval will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. NXP may assign this Agreement, or any part of
this Agreement, in its sole discretion.
