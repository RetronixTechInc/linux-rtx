NVIDIA Carmel Uncore PMU
========================

This driver supports hardware perfmon event counting for the 4 L2 clusters
and for the L3. The supported events are standard ARM L2/L3 event numbering,
but shifted and masked with a unit number for the sake of granular unit
tracking. The event format is EEU, where 'EE' is the standard ARM event number
and U is the unit (0-3 for the L2s, 4 for the L3).

Required properties:
	- compatible : "nvidia,carmel-pmu"
	- interrupts : single hardware-specified interrupt
	- interrupt-affinity : this driver must be pinned to Carmel core 0 (cpu@0)
		in order to correctly field PMU interrupts from the L2/L3 units.

Example:
	carmel-pmu {
		compatible = "nvidia,carmel-pmu";
		interrupts = <0 365 0x4>;
		interrupt-affinity = <&{/cpus/cpu@0}>;
	};
